# netlify-discord
every time someone goes on a netlify page it will alert me on discord 


[app](https://netlify-discord.netlify.app/ "app")

[api link](https://netlify-discord.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/app/ "api linkie")


wait i might make it just a front end with frontend js sending reqests to discord.
